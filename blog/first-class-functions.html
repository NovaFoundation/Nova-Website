    <h1>HOW FIRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS WORK</h1>
    <p>
        First-class functions in their essence are just variables that point to executable code (functions). However, there are some key aspects that define what a first-class function means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can pass functions as arguments to other functions</li>
        <li>Can return a function as a return value from a function</li>
        <li>Can assign functions to variables</li>
        <li>Can store functions in collections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These points boil down to the fact that <i>functions should act like variables</i>.
    </p>
    <div id="function-as-parameters">
        <h3>PASSING FUNCTIONS AS ARGUMENTS TO OTHER FUNCTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            This functionality is already available in Nova, and has been since the first Beta release. Defining a function that takes a function as an argument looks like:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            func1(myFirstClassFunc(String, Int)) {
                for (i in 0..10) {
                    myFirstClassFunc("iteration #i", i)
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            This function requires a function that takes at most String and Int as a parameter. I say <i>at most</i> because the functions that are passed to func1 are not required to take all of the parameters that the myFirstClassFunc parameter has. For example, you could match the myFirstClassFunc parameter definition exactly like:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            exactFunc(String s, Int x) {
                Console.writeLine("String count * x == #{s.count * x}")
            }
            
            func1(exactFunc) // valid
        </div>
        <p>
            Or you could give it a function that only contains 1 or even 0 parameters:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            zeroFunc() {
                Console.writeLine("Im pretty useless, but thats ok")
            }
            
            oneFunc(String s) {
                Console.writeLine("I only took the String parameter: #s")
            }
            
            func1(zeroFunc) // valid
            func1(oneFunc) // valid
        </div>
        <p>
            Passing functions as arguments to functions is one of the core aspects of the mapping and filtering functionality of the List framework.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="functions-return-functions">
        <h3>RETURNING FUNCTIONS AS RETURN VALUES</h3>
        <p>
           Returning functions from functions looks like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            otherFunc(String x, Int y) {
                Console.writeLine("Received #x and #y")
            }
            
            func1() -> myFirstClassFunc(String, Int) {
                return otherFunc
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            The func1 returns a function that takes a String and Int as parameters. In this case, it just returns otherFunc, but you can also do some more interesting things like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            otherFunc(String x, Int y) {
                Console.writeLine("Received #x and #y")
            }
            
            func1(String input) -> myFirstClassFunc(String, Int) {
                return (x, y) => {
                    for (i in 0..5) {
                        Console.writeLine("Parameter: #input")
                        
                        otherFunc(x, y * i)
                    }
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            This func1 returns a lambda (aka anonymous function) that takes a String and Int. The types of the parameters for the lambda are deduced from the return type of the func1 function. Calling the function that is returned from the function would write func1's input parameter to the console 5 times, as well as calling 'otherFunc' 5 times.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="functions-as-variables">
        <h3>ASSIGNING FUNCTIONS TO VARIABLES</h3>
        <p>
           Assigning functions to variables looks like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            func1(String input) -> myFirstClassFunc(String, Int) {
                return (x, y) => {
                    for (i in 0..5) {
                        Console.writeLine("Parameter: #input")
                        
                        otherFunc(x, y * i)
                    }
                }
            }
            
            var x = func1
        </div>
        <p>
            This saves the func1 reference into the variable variable x. You can then invoke the x function reference like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            x("pass string") // valid
            x("pass string", 1) // valid
            x("pass string", 1, "asdfasdf") // valid
            x("pass string", null, 90.0, 100) // valid
        </div>
        <p>
            You can pass as many arguments to the function as you want, as long as you fulfill the original functions parameters. The original parameters, in this instance, are a single String. However, the extra parameters that are passed to the function will be never used.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="functions-in-collections">
        <h3>STORING FUNCTIONS IN COLLECTIONS</h3>
        <p>
            Storing functions in collections extends upon the ability to assign to them variables. For instance, when able to store functions in collections, this is possible:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            func1(String input) -> myFirstClassFunc(String, Int) {
                return (String x, Int y) => {
                    for (i in 0..5) {
                        Console.writeLine("Parameter: #input")
                        
                        otherFunc(x, y * i)
                    }
                }
            }
            
            let array = new function(String)[]
            
            array.add(func1)
            array.add(x => {
                Console.writeLine("In lambda that was passed #x")
            })
            array.add({
                Console.writeLine("In lambda that takes no parameters")
            })
        </div>
        <p>
            The <span class="pre">array</span> array stores functions that, at most, take a String as a parameter. You could later call the functions that are contained in this array like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            array.forEach(func => {
                func("say something")
            })
        </div>
        <p>
            This would output:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            In lambda that was passed say something
            In lambda that takes no parameters
        </div>
        <p>
            The first <span class="pre">func1</span> value does not output anything because the function that it <i>returned</i> was not invoked.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

        <h3>RUNTIME MODULE LOADING</h3>
        <p>
            First-class functions have an important role in loading modules at runtime. When you load a module at runtime you can access fields and functions from that module dynamically. Accessing fields is pretty self explanatory; you are returned the value of the field. Functions on the other hand require a function reference to be returned in order to be useful.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="functional-paradigm">
        <h3>FUNCTIONAL PARADIGM</h3>
        <p>
            Functional coding also has a inherent need for first-class functions. When programming in the functional paradigm, you expect functions to behave like variables because thats essentially what the paradigm is built off of.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="concise">
        <h3>MORE CONCISE CODE</h3>
        <p>
            First-class functions can reduce the amount of code to perform tasks. This is an important point considering one of the founding principles of Nova is <i>speed of development</i>. When you reduce the amount of code to solve a problem, you often times are reducing the time it takes to complete the task.
        </p>
        <p>
            This can be demonstrated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">strategy pattern</a> design pattern. This pattern is used when you want to run different algorithms based off of different conditions, <i>at runtime</i>. To illustrate this, lets suppose that you want to enforce a specific pricing algorithm depending on the type of the day. With the strategy pattern you could do this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            interface Billable {
                calculatePrice(Double originalPrice)
            }
            
            class NormalHours implements Billable {
                calculatePrice(Double originalPrice) => originalPrice
            }
            
            class HappyHour implements Billable {
                calculatePrice(Double originalPrice) => originalPrice / 2
            }
            
            class SurgeHour implements Billable {
                calculatePrice(Double originalPrice) => originalPrice * 2
            }
            
            class Customer {
                Billable billStrategy = new NormalHours()
                
                Double sum = 0
                
                public charge() {
                    sum += billStrategy.calculatePrice(5)
                }
            }
            
            public static main(String[] args) {
                let c1 = new Customer()
                
                c1.charge() // 5
                
                //surge hour
                c1.billStrategy = new SurgeHour()
                c1.charge() // 10
                
                // happy hour
                c1.billStrategy = new HappyHour()
                c1.charge() // 2.5
                c1.charge() // 2.5
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            The customer would leave with a bill of $20. This same process could be done with first-class functions like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            class Customer {
                var billStrategy(Double) -> Double = x => x
                
                Double sum = 0
                
                public charge() {
                    sum += billStrategy(5)
                }
            }
            
            public static main(String[] args) {
                let c1 = new Customer()
                
                c1.charge() // 5
                
                //surge hour
                c1.billStrategy = x => x * 2
                c1.charge() // 10
                
                // happy hour
                c1.billStrategy = x => x / 2
                c1.charge() // 2.5
                c1.charge() // 2.5
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            This code is much shorter and accomplishes the same result. The first-class function method reduces the amount of allocation required to complete the task, as well as the amount of code. However, some people might argue that the strategy pattern is more readable and scalable. If you are well versed with first-class functions, then the first implication of the argument is false, however the the scalability of the strategy pattern is a valid point. If you need to add extra fields to a specific billing algorithm, then the strategy pattern might be best. But for simple routine function abstract algorithms, first-class functions is often a better choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            First-class functions that can be returned by a function, assigned to a variable, and stored in collections, will be added in the v0.3.8 release. The target release date for v0.3.8 is next week on 3/5/2017. If you are seeing this after v0.3.8 has been released, then you can see the release notes <a ui-sref="blog.v0_3_8-release-notes-">here</a>. Otherwise that link will be a broken link.
