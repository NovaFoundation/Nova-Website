    <h1>CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES</h1>

    <p>The Nova compiler has 3 core design principles that guide the development:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#separation-of-concerns">Separation of concerns</a></li>
        <li><a href="#extensibility">Extensibility</a></li>
        <li><a href="#simplicity">Simplicity</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These principles guide each decision that is made on the design of the compiler. </p>
</div>

<div id="separation-of-concerns">
    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">SEPARATION OF CONCERNS</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Nova compilation process is separated into 4 distinct phases: parser, code inspector, code optimizer, and code generator. This separation is an important factor of what makes the other core design principles of extensibility and simplicity possible.

    <h3>Parser</h3>
    <p>
        The parser's job is to parse the source code, from an <i>input language</i>, to an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). "Input language" is italicised to bring attention to the fact that the compiler is not restricted to Nova code only. Any language can be compiled with the Nova compiler if a parser is written for that language. Because all of the parsing code is separated out into the parse phase, the parser is the <i>only</i> component that needs to be written to add support for an additional input language. For example, if you want to add support for compiling Swift code with the Nova compiler, the only component you need to write is the parser.
    </p>
    <h3>Code inspector</h3>
    <p>
        The code inspector is where type validation for the code is done. This is where most compile-time errors and warnings are generated. This phase makes sure the code is valid before handing it off to the code optimizer.
    </p>
    <h3>Code optimizer</h3>
    <p>
        This is the phase where the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) is transformed. There are many reasons you would want to transform the AST including to: improve performance, obfuscate code (to help keep proprietary code private), minify code, inject custom functionality (e.g. benchmarking timers), and much more.
    </p>
    <h3>Code generator</h3>
    <p>
        The code generator is the inverse of the parser. This phase takes the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and writes it to a specified target language. In the same way that when you write a new parser you gain access to all of the libraries written in the language that is being parsed, when writing a new code generator for a specified language, that language gains access to all of <i>Nova's</i> libraries. This is great because it means that all code that you write in Nova is not only usable in a Nova project, it also can be used in the specified target language. For example, if you write a Swift code generator, then you can use any code written in Nova natively in a Swift project.
    </p>

<div id="extensibility">
    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">EXTENSIBILITY</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The extensibility of the compiler is incredibly important for the development to reach the scale that is necessary for Nova to become widely adopted. As a result of the separation of concerns, writing extensions to each of the compilation phases is made exponentially easier. Instead of having to know a whole complicated compiler system, you only have to know how the specific component you are extending works. For instance, if you need to write a new parser, you only have to know how to parse code; you dont need to know how to check types, optimize the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), or generate the code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some reasons you might want to extend each of the components of the compiler:
    </p>
    <h3>Parsers</h3>
    <p>
        Writing a new parser allows any other language to have <i>all</i> of the functionality that Nova has. Once a parser is written for a language, you get all of the functionality of any existing code inspectors, optimizers, and code generators. You could even use the parser strictly as a translater to Nova by outputting the code with the Nova code generator.
    </p>
    <p>
        The separation of concerns of the parser is incredibly powerful because it allows for rapid development of new input languages. Each new language that can be compiled by the Nova compiler adds to the available libraries for all Nova programs.
    </p>
    <h3>Code inspectors</h3>
    <p>
        Reasons you would write extensions for this phase is to add more comprehensive, or better, warning and error messages. Examples of extensions that could be added include:
        <div style="margin-left: 25px;">
            <h4>Spell checkers</h4>
            <p>Spell check comments, identifiers, etc.</p>
            <h4>Formatting convention validation</h4>
            <p>You could throw compilation errors whenever a program does not fulfill a specified formatting convention. This is helpful when writing software in teams.</p>
        </div>
    </p>
    <h3>Code optimizers</h3>
    <p>
        There are many reasons to write code optimizers. The ability to choose which optimizers you do or do not want to run during compilation gives fine tuned control to the user on how they want their program to be built. Some common reasons to write optimizer components include:
        <div style="margin-left: 25px;">
            <h4>Improving performance</h4>
            <p>Inlining functions, unrolling loops, removing dead code, etc.</p>
            <h4>Profiling code</h4>
            <p>You could add timers sections of the code to observe the performance of those areas.</p>
        </div>
    </p>
    <h3>Code generators</h3>
    <p>
        Implementing a code generator means adding support for Nova on a new platform. As mentioned before, you can write code generators to other languages to give that language full support of any libraries written in Nova. Adding new language targets also adds the ability for Nova programs to run on any of the platforms and architectures that the target language can run on. For example, if you generate the code to the Javascript language, you can run all of your Nova code in the browser. You can also interact with the generated Nova code from any existing Javascript libraries.
    </p>

<div id="simplicity">
    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">SIMPLICITY</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        As with the language itself, simplicity is a very core design principle. The separation of concerns really aids in keeping the compiler simple; there are no unnecessary complications caused by communication between the phases. Unnecessary communication is often a sign of bad software design and can lead to hard to detect bugs in code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best prevention for these bugs that I have found is to keep the compiler as simple as possible. The simplicity is not to be confused with being rigid or inflexible. The idea is to have several components that operate within their own lane, and have these components compose what is the Nova compiler.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="moving-forward" style="margin-top: 40px;">
    <h2>MOVING FORWARD</h2>
    <p>
        This is only the first evolution of the compiler and I expect a lot to change in the future when there are more components built on it, as well as more different perspectives on it from the community.
    </p>
