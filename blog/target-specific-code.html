    <h1>WHEN DO YOU NEED TO WRITE TARGET SPECIFIC CODE?</h1>
    <p>
        If you are writing a program that you need to be available on a wide range of devices, then you will most likely come across a situation where you need to write some device-specific code. That is where target-specific code comes into play. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, say you are writing a mobile application. You want this app to be available on iPhone and Android. However, iPhone and Android apps are programmed with two different languages and APIs. To overcome this, you can either use a library that acts as an abstraction layer (more on this soon<!-- <footnote id="abstraction-layer"></footnote>-->), or you can write the target-specific code yourself. The first option offers a much cleaner and easier approach, while the second option can offer more fine tuned control on every aspect of your app.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am going to demonstrate how to write target-specific code yourself in this post.

    <h2>ORGANIZING THE CODE</h2>
    <p>
        Building off of the mobile app plotline, lets lay out a package structure for this app:
    </p>
    <div hljs language="bash" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        MyApp/
        |----> com/
            |----> myapp/
                |----> ui/
                    |----> MessageBox.nova
                    |----> MessageBox.swift.nova
                    |----> MessageBox.java.nova
                    |----> Table.nova
                    |----> Table.swift.nova
                    |----> Table.java.nova
                    |----> Photo.nova
                    |----> Photo.swift.nova
                    |----> Photo.java.nova
                |----> notifications/
                    |----> Notification.nova
                    |----> Notification.swift.nova
                    |----> Notification.java.nova
                    |----> PushNotification.nova
                    |----> PushNotification.swift.nova
                    |----> PushNotification.java.nova
                |----> audio/
                    |----> Sound.nova
                    |----> Sound.swift.nova
                    |----> Sound.java.nova
                    |----> Song.nova
                    |----> Song.swift.nova
                    |----> Song.java.nova
                |----> ClassA.nova
                |----> ClassB.nova
                |----> Main.nova
    </div>
    <p>
        Notice how there are some files with .swift and .java extensions paired with the original .nova files. Whenever a <i>Filename.nova</i> file has a <i>Filename.target.nova</i> file paired with it in the same package, the contents of the <i>Filename.target.nova</i> file overrides the contents of the <i>Filename.nova</i> file. Lets see an example of this:
    </p>
    <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        // MessageBox.nova
        class MessageBox {
            visible String message
            
            public construct(visible String message) {}
            
            public show() {
                throw new Exception("A target implementation needs to override this function!")
            }
            
            public close() {
                throw new Exception("A target implementation needs to override this function!")
            }
        }
    </div>
    <p>
        This is our MessageBox base implementation. It expects one of the paired files to override the show and close functions. This is done like the following:
    </p>
    <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        // MessageBox.swift.nova
        class MessageBox {
            public show() {
                // do some swift message box showing code here
                external swift {
                    let alert = UIAlertController(
                            title: "Alert",
                            message: #{message},
                            preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.Alert)
                    
                    self.present(alert, animated: true, completion: nil)
                }
            }
            
            public close() {
                // do some swift message box closing code here
            }
        }
    </div>
    <p>
        When creating a target-specific file override, you only need to add the functions that you are overriding (e.g. no need to override the constructor). It is in the target-specific functions above that you will call the corresponding swift code necessary to <i>show</i> and <i>close</i> the MessageBox.
    </p>
    <p>
        You only need to add these target-specific file overrides for files that have different implementations depending on the language the program is being compiled to.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="compiling-code">
    <h2>COMPILING THE CODE</h2>
    <p>
        When you want to compile your code to the specific target (Swift or Java in this case), you need to tell the compiler which target to output as. Assuming you have the required compilation targets included in your Nova compiler package, you can use the following commands:
    </p>
    <div hljs language="bash" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        novac MyApp -target swift -d MySwiftApp
    </div>
    <p>and</p>
    <div hljs language="bash" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        novac MyApp -target java -d MyJavaApp
    </div>
    <p>
        will do the trick. After running these commands, you will have a MySwiftApp and MyJavaApp directory created that contains the swift and java code respectively available to use for your iOS and Android app!
    </p>
</div>

<div id="best-of-both-worlds">
    <h2>THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS</h2>
    <p>
        The ability to separate target-specific code into separate files in Nova offers a clean solution to managing target-specific code across a project where you might have otherwise had to write two completely separate codebases for each individual target. With the integration offered by the target-specific files, you retain access to all of the general libraries and functionality written for your app across each of the different targets, while allowing complete control over each of the target specific aspects. You get the best of both worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
        It makes sense to write the code for a single app in a single codebase, regardless of the device that it runs on. Target-specific files is Nova's answer to the small percentage of target-specific code needed between each target.
