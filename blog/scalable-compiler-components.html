    <h1>RUNTIME LOADED COMPILER COMPONENTS</h1>
    <p>
        The Nova compiler is being developed with the aim of being the most scalable compiler ever. The approach that is being taken to do this is to make use of <a ui-sref="blog.runtime-module-loading">runtime module loading</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The blog post that was written on runtime module loading was geared toward the essence of runtime module loading, not necessarily the application of it. This post is going to explain how runtime loading of modules is applied within the compiler.

    <h1>COMPILER STRUCTURE</h1>
    <p>
        I wrote a blog post on the <a ui-sref="blog.compiler-design">compiler design</a> and how it is had three core principles: Separation of concerns, extensibility, and simplicity. The source of how a lot of each of those principles are kept rely on the scalability of the compiler. Here is a refresher on the structure of the compiler:
    </p>
    <div class="flow-container">

       The key to the scalability is to load these components at runtime. Each of these components resides in its own module.
    </p>
    <div id="why-runtime">
        <h3>WHY AT RUNTIME?</h3>
        <p>
            Why is the key to scalability to load the components at runtime? Why not compile them with the rest of the code? Compiling in a single compilation unit requires all of the packages to be known and available at the time of the compile. This does not allow for adding, removing, or configuring the components limitlessly without recompiling the whole system.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fact that the components are loaded at runtime is the reason that, theoretically, there could be a single release of the core Nova compiler foundation classes, and they then could never have to be touched ever again. The probability of this happening is <i>highly</i> unrealistic in practice, but the ability of it is there.
        </p>

<div id="module-examples">
    <h1>HOW COMPILER MODULES ARE LOADED</h1>
    <p><i><b>Disclaimer</b>: The following code is just demo code to give a general idea of what the implementation looks like. There will be individual blog posts on each of the specific component types in the future where the implementation details and specifics are shared.</i></p>
    <p>
        The compiler looks for classes that extend or implement specific classes or interfaces to determine what components to run for each stage of compilation. After loading the Library (explained in the <a href="blog.runtime-module-loading">previous blog post</a>), you can search for classes that extended or implement a specific class or interface with the Class.getClassesOfType function<footnote id="class-filtering"></footnote>.
    </p>
    <div id="parsers">
        <h3>PARSER COMPONENTS</h3>
        <p>
            Let's look at an example Parser component to help illustrate this. When searching for a parser, the compiler searches for classes that extend the class "NodeParser". The NodeParser class contains function definitions used to parse statements that are iterated over. The base NodeParser class looks like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            class NodeParser {
                public static parse(String input, Node parent = null, Location location = Location.INVALID) -> Node => null {
                    ...
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            Parser components build their parsing framework on top of this class. For instance, an Assignment parser might look something like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            // Import the findOperatorOnTopLevel extension function, as well
            // as many other useful extension functions for parsing.
            import "novex/astro/util/CompilerStringFunctions"
            
            class AssignmentParser extends NodeParser {
                public static parse(String input, Node parent = null, Location location = Location.INVALID) -> Assignment => null {
                    let assignmentIndex = input.findOperatorOnTopLevel('=')
                    
                    if (assignmentIndex > 0) {
                        let node = new Assignment(parent, location)
                        
                        if (node.parseAssignedNode(findAssigned(input, assignmentIndex)) &amp;&amp;
                            node.parseAssignment(findAssignment(input, assignmentIndex))) {
                            node.operators.add(new Operator(parent: node, value: "="))
                            
                            return node
                        }
                    }
                }
                
                ...
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            This AssignmentWriter example first searches for the index of the equals sign in the assignment. If the index exists at a valid position (the index must be > 0 for it to be valid), then it tries to parse the assigned node (the left-hand side of the assignment) <i>and</i> the assignment node (the right-hand side of the assignment) using their own parsers. If all of that is successful, then it returns the parsed Assignment node.
        </p>
        <p>
            Applying this parser pattern to each different type of Node is what is required to create a Parser component. This kind of divide and conquer through using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser">recursive-descent parser</a> pattern is recommended to make the most of the Object oriented nature of Nova.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="inspectors">
        <h3>CODE INSPECTOR COMPONENTS</h3>
        <p>
            The code inspector components are run after the parsers have constructed the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The compiler's code inspector foundation code traverses the tree and calls upon the inspector components on the types of nodes that they are looking at.
        </p>
        <p>
            A simple example is a spell checker. This spell checker just looks at identifiers to validate that they are spelled correctly. As with the Parsers, code inspectors has a base class that is required to be extended from in order for the foundational compiler framework to find it. The class's name is "CodeInspector".
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            class CodeInspector {
                visible Class[] targetTypes => []
                
                public inspect(Node node) {
                    ...
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            Extending the CodeInspector class, the spell checker example looks like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            class SpellChecker extends CodeInspector {
                public Class[] targetTypes => [Identifier]
                
                public inspect(Node node) {
                    // We know it's an Identifier because that is the only
                    // class type allowed in the targetTypes array
                    let identifier = (Identifier)node
                    
                    if (SomeFancyDictionary.isSpellingError(identifier.name)) {
                        let suggestions = SomeFancyDictionary.getSuggestions(identifier.name)
                        let suggestionsText = suggestions.count > 0 ?
                            "Some suggestions include: " + suggestions.join(", ") : ""
                        
                        toss new SpellCheckWarning("Identifier '#identifier.name' is not spelled correctly. " +
                            suggestionsText,
                            identifier)
                    }
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            This code checks a class called "SomeFancyDictionary" for the word, and if it is not spelled correctly, it offers some suggestions to fix it in the warning. The warning itself is generated by tossing a SpellCheckWarning which is a class that the SpellChecker component contains that extends CompilerWarning. The implementation looks like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            class SpellCheckWarning extends CompilerWarning {
                public construct(String message, Node cause) {
                    super(message, cause)
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            It is essentially an extension of the CompilerWarning. It is good to create distinct warning and error classes for different types of errors in order to add more helpful information for when the user sees it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason that the warning is <i>tossed</i> is because we do not want to halt execution of the code inspector for a spelling error. Toss allows you to save the warning to the output and continue the flow of the inspector.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="optimizers">
        <h3>CODE OPTIMIZER COMPONENTS</h3>
        <p>
            The code optimizer components are run after the Abstract Syntax Tree has been validated. Just as the code inspector components, the compiler's code optimizer foundation code traverses the tree and calls upon the optimizer components on the types of nodes that they are looking at.
        </p>
        <p>
            Code optimizer components extend the TreeTransformer class that looks like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            class TreeTransformer {
                visible Class[] targetTypes => []
                
                public transform(Node node) {
                    ...
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            This class has the targetTypes array just like the CodeInspector class. The method used to perform the transformation is called "transform". An example optimizer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling">unrolling simple loops</a> might look like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            class LoopUnrollTransformer extends TreeTransformer {
                visible Class[] targetTypes => [ForEachLoop]
                
                public transform(Node node) {
                    let loop = (ForEachLoop)node
                    
                    if (!loop.iterator.class.isOfType(IntegerRange)) {
                        // Don't transform if it is not iterating over an integer range
                        return
                    }
                    
                    let range = (IntegerRange)loop.iterator
                    let start = range.start
                    let end = range.end
                    
                    if (!start.class.isOfType(Literal) ||
                        !start.type.typeClass.extends("nova/primitive/number/Integer") ||
                        !end.class.isOfType(Literal) ||
                        !end.type.typeClass.extends("nova/primitive/number/Integer") ) {
                        // Don't transform if the integer range doesn't use literal
                        // integer values as it's bounds. Can't unroll loops with
                        // variable bounds.
                        return
                    }
                    
                    let startLiteral = (Literal)start
                    let endLiteral = (Literal)end
                    
                    let startValue = Int.parse(startLiteral.value)
                    let endValue = Int.parse(endLiteral.value)
                    
                    let replacementScope = new Scope(node.parent, node.location)
                    
                    // Unroll the contents of the foreach loop into a replacementScope
                    // buffer before replacing the foreach loop with the scope.
                    for (var i in startValue..endValue) {
                        let clonedContents = loop.scope.clone()
                        
                        replacementScope.addChild(clonedContents)
                    }
                    
                    node.replaceWith(replacementScope)
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            This is an extremely basic implementation, but it should get the point across of how optimizer components are implemented.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="generators">
        <h3>CODE GENERATOR COMPONENTS</h3>
        <p>
            The code generator components are designed similarly to the parsers. The writer components extend a "NodeWriter" class that takes a Node and writes it to an output stream. The definition of the NodeWriter class looks like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            class NodeWriter {
                public static write(Node node, OutputStream writer) => writer {
                    ...
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            And an implementation of an AssignmentWriter might look like this:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape>
            class AssignmentWriter extends NodeWriter {
                public static write(Assignment node, OutputStream writer) => writer {
                    ValueWriter.write(node.assigned)
                    writer.write(" = ")
                    ValueWriter.write(node.assignment)
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            Again, this uses the divide and conquer philosophy to accomplish the task. The assignment simply makes use of the ValueWriter to output the assigned and assignment parts of the assignment.
