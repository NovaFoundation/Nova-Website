    <h1>WHAT IS YIELD?</h1>
    <p>
        Yield is a keyword in several different languages that is used to create free-form enumerable types. That is, types that that can be iterated over. They are often used instead of map and filter functionality in favor of saving memory and being more performant. Instead of creating a new list data structure to hold a temporary set of data that is only used to iterator over, you simply return a specific element at a specific position until some condition is met. This is in contrast to mapping and filtering, where a new list data structure would be created for each type of iteration that is needed.

        <h3>THE ESSENCE AND INNER WORKINGS OF YIELD</h3>
        <p>
            Here is an example in C# of the yield keyword:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="csharp" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                foreach (int fib in Fibs(6))
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(fib + " ");
                }
            }

            static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; Fibs(int fibCount)
            {
                for (int i = 0, prevFib = 0, currFib = 1; i < fibCount; i++)
                {
                    yield return prevFib;
                    
                    int newFib = prevFib + currFib;
                    
                    prevFib = currFib;
                    currFib = newFib;
                }
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            In this example, the foreach loop uses the <span class="pre">IEnumerable</span> returned from the <span class="pre">Fibs</span> function to iterate a specified number of Fibonacci numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Nova, you can achieve the same result with the following code:
        </p>
        <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
            public static main(String[] args) {
                for (fib in fibs(6)) {
                    Console.writeLine("#fib ")
                }
            }

            static fibs(Int fibCount) -> Int[] {
                var prevFib = 0
                var currFib = 1
                
                return new Int[fibCount].map({
                    let value = prevFib
                    
                    prevFib = currFib
                    currFib += value
                    
                    return value
                })
            }
        </div>
        <p>
            The difference between the two code examples is that in the C# example, no data structure is allocated to iterate over the Fibonacci numbers. The implementation of the yield keyword under the hood is essentially a complex state-machine that waits to be iterated over. The back-end code can be visualized as something comparable to the next code example. This is a vast over-simplification of the state-machine, but it gets the point across<footnote id="csharp-yield-backend"></footnote>:

            I trimmed the state-machine down to it's conceptual essence, so this example does not have all the components necessary to compile and run. The whole state-machine revolves around the <span class="pre">state</span> field, and the switch in the <span class="pre type">MoveNext</span> method. This example of a state-machine contains 3 different states:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>0</b>: The state-machine has just been initialized</li>
            <li><b>1</b>: The state-machine is currently processing a result</li>
            <li><b>2</b>: The state-machine has processed and returned a result</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These states give the illusion of continuity between jumping in and out of the state-machine, without having to allocate memory to store temporary data generated from a call to map or filter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main idea to take away from the state-machine implementation is that there is <i>no allocation</i> for a list.

            Although you save memory from not generating a temporary buffer, there are some drawbacks to this approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            You create add an extra keyword to the language vocabulary. Adding keywords to languages is not necessarily a bad thing, if they are reducing the amount of work you would have otherwise done in place of the keyword. In the case of the yield keyword, there is no substantial reduction of code that results from using it over mapping or filtering functionality. The benefit it gives is <i>performance</i>. You aren't allocating unnecessary memory, and thus the program runs faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the yield keyword does some sneaky things behind the scenes, the state-machine construct can create some obscure bugs as well<footnote id="obscure-behavior"></footnote>.

    <h1>NOVA'S SOLUTION</h1>
    <p>
        If the compiler were able to somehow know that the list of Fibonacci numbers generated from the Fib function were only used in place at that one location, then you wouldn't need to use the yield keyword to gain this performance, the compiler could optimize the map and filter functions to run in place. This is the solution that Nova will use. Take a look at the use of the <span class="pre">map</span> function in the Nova example again:
    </p>
    <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        public static main(String[] args) {
            for (fib in fibs(6)) {
                Console.writeLine("#fib ")
            }
        }

        static fibs(Int fibCount) -> Int[] {
            var prevFib = 0
            var currFib = 1
            
            return new Int[fibCount].map({
                let value = prevFib
                
                prevFib = currFib
                currFib += value
                
                return value
            })
        }
    </div>
    <p>
        Now lets focus on the following section of the code:
    </p>
    <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        return new Int[fibCount].map({
            let value = prevFib
            
            prevFib = currFib
            currFib += value
            
            return value
        })
    </div>
    <p>
        First off, that there is an explicit Int[] allocation, yet none of the values of the array are ever accessed or set. It is just used to specify the size of the returning list, and to call the map function that generates the list of Fibonacci numbers. This can be optimized out by inlining the contents of the map function from the Array class and replacing the foreach constraint with the size-constraint. The resulting code could look something like:
    </p>
    <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        let array = new Int[fibCount]
        
        // Replaced with size constraint instead of "for (element in this)"
        for (i in 0..fibCount) {
            let value = prevFib
            
            prevFib = currFib
            currFib += value
            
            array.add(value)
        }
        
        return array
    </div>
    <p>
        Now lets see it all together again:
    </p>
    <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        public static main(String[] args) {
            for (fib in fibs(6)) {
                Console.writeLine("#fib ")
            }
        }

        static fibs(Int fibCount) -> Int[] {
            var prevFib = 0
            var currFib = 1
            
            let array = new Int[fibCount]
            
            // Replaced with size constraint instead of "for (element in this)"
            for (i in 0..fibCount) {
                let value = prevFib
                
                prevFib = currFib
                currFib += value
                
                array.add(value)
            }
            
            return array
        }
    </div>
    <p>
        This took care of the first Int[] allocation and inlined the map lambda, but there is still one Int[] allocation left remaining. At this point, if we remove the remaining array, we loose the return value and thus change the meaning of the function. What if someone wanted to actually receive an array from the fibs function? To address this, Nova will create an Iterator not too different than how the state-machine is built. This iterator will be used in place of calling the fibs function.
    </p>
    <div hljs language="java" hljs-no-escape style="text-align: center; margin: 40px 0;">
        public static main(String[] args) {
            for (fib in new FibsIterator(6)) {
                Console.writeLine("#fib ")
            }
        }
        
        class FibsIterator implements Iterator&lt;Int&gt; {
            var Int prevFib = 0
            var Int currFib = 1
            
            Int fibCount
            
            public construct(Int fibCount) {
                this.fibCount = fibCount
            }
            
            visible Bool hasNext => i < fibCount
            
            visible Int next {
                get {
                    let value = prevFib
                    
                    prevFib = currFib
                    currFib += value
                    
                    i++
                    
                    return value
                }
            }
        }
    </div>
    <p>
        As how functions that make use of the yield keyword in C# are used, The FibsIterator call will only replace the calls to fibs that are strictly used to <i>iterate over the values</i> and not to store them in a data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        With these optimizations in place, you get the same performance you would get from using yield's state-machine, but you stay within the realm of maps and filters. The real goal and aspiration of this solution is to keep programmers within the realm of using map and filter. The more often these functions and data structures are used, the more libraries are compatible and consistent with each other. 
    </p>
</div>

<div id="conclusion">
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        While in C#, using the yield keyword can give a performance boost based on less allocation, if the compiler could optimize out the allocation in the first place, there would be no need for such a keyword. Adding a keyword adds complexity to the language, and as stated before, the only benefit the yield keyword gives is performance. Because Nova can optimize out map and filter calls to the same performance of having used the yield keyword, there is no point in adding it to the language. This is why there will never be a yield keyword in Nova.
