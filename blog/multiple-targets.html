    <h1>WHAT DOES COMPILING TO MULTIPLE TARGETS REALLY MEAN?</h1>
    <p>
        If you have not programmed in a language that allows compilation to multiple different compilation targets, then you probably are unaware of the benefits (and possible drawbacks) of using a language that offers this feature. Furthermore, you might not even know what exactly compiling to multiple targets means.

    <p>
        When you think of traditional programming languages, there is a common process that you go through when compiling the source code that looks something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="flow-container">
        <p style="white-space: nowrap;">SOURCE CODE</p>
        <img class="down-arrow" src="/content/images/down-arrow.svg" /><br>
        <div class="flow-stage"><p>COMPILER</p></div><br>
        <img class="down-arrow" src="/content/images/down-arrow.svg" /><br>
        <p style="white-space: nowrap;">EXECUTABLE or SHARED LIBRARY</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        You feed your source code into a compiler, and that compiler transforms it into an executable or shared library of some sort. You go from a high-level source code file, to a binary executable or shared library <footnote id="gcc-asm"></footnote>. Generally, this is how it has been done for a long time.
