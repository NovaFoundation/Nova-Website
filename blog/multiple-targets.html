    <h1>WHAT DOES COMPILING TO MULTIPLE TARGETS REALLY MEAN?</h1>
    <p>
        If you have not programmed in a language that allows compilation to multiple different compilation targets, then you probably are unaware of the benefits (and possible drawbacks) of using a language that offers this feature. Furthermore, you might not even know what exactly compiling to multiple targets means.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you think of traditional programming languages, there is a common process that you go through when compiling the source code that looks something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="flow-container">
        <p style="white-space: nowrap;">SOURCE CODE</p>
        <img class="down-arrow" src="/content/images/down-arrow.svg" /><br>
        <div class="flow-stage"><p>COMPILER</p></div><br>
        <img class="down-arrow" src="/content/images/down-arrow.svg" /><br>
        <p style="white-space: nowrap;">EXECUTABLE or SHARED LIBRARY</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        You feed your source code into a compiler, and that compiler transforms it into an executable or shared library of some sort. You go from a high-level source code file, to a binary executable or shared library <footnote id="gcc-asm"></footnote>. Generally, this is how it has been done for a long time.

<div id="benefits">
    <h1>BENEFITS OF MULTIPLE COMPILATION TARGETS</h1>
    <p>
        When you have more targets available to compile to, you have more data points on the performance of your programs from different perspectives. This allows for a whole new area of performance analysis that has not been touched. The ability to compare performance of a program from different languages gives insite comparable to adding a whole new dimension to the field. For example,

<div id="drawbacks">
    <h1>DRAWBACKS OF MULTIPLE COMPILATION TARGETS</h1>
    <p>
        When you deal with multiple targets, you can add the complexity of each language along with it. The Nova language is designed to make this as cheap as possible, but there is always going to be some work required when adding another compilation target, especially if the target language is a considerably different paradigm.

<div id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        With both sides of the argument given, I believe that the benefits greatly outweigh the possible drawbacks. The extra dimension that multiple targets adds alone is something worth investigating.
